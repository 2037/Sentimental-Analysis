# Introduction
This project is to test machine learning algorithms on prediction of emoji based on input text, like product reviews, or the sentiment of the financial news. 

For word embedding, I used Word2Vec method based on Glove (glove.6B.50d.txt). Then I treat it as a supervised multiclass classification problem. The following algorithms are used to be trained and predict: Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and LSTM.
